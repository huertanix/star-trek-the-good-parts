# A Curated Tour of Star Trek: Enterprise

One of many disappointments of my angsty high school life in 2001 involved watching Star Trek die[1]. The first things I did on the internet was read Star Trek rumors spread on BBSs and Geocities sites over a 33.6k BPS modem[2]. A new Trek series was the topic of a lot of discussion. Out of that two different narratives were revealed: A look into the far-future with a ship stuck in a time warp getting unstuck to a fallen Federation with tasked with rebuilding it, and a prequel (because Star Wars) sometime between Zephram Cochrane drunk driving
into Warp 1 and Kirk having it with these muthafucking tribbles on this muthafucking starship.

The former show became Andromeda, also a disappointment except that it had space-Smithsonian rebuilding galactic civilization with Hercules, which I thought was cool. The latter became Enterprise, which originally dropped the "Star Trek" moniker and had a country song open each episode to tap into the King of the Hill audience or something. I never made to past the first season.

Fast forward to 2014 and having a much faster, albeit less reliable TWC cable connection in Brooklyn, I get sick for a week and decide to hate-watch Enterprise if only for nostalgia and maybe some closure. It turned out, however, that there were some gems hidden in the filler. These are the voyages worth watching:

## Star Trek: First Contact

Not an episode of Enterprise, but necessary for understanding wtf people in the show are talking about when they mention first contact and Zephram Cochrane. Also great because you see the maturity of 21st vs. 24th century humans side-by-side so you get an idea of the awkward changes humanity is going through in Enterprise's in-between time period.

## Broken Bow, Part 1 and 2

aka shot across the bow because it's the first sign the rest of the series is going to suck. tl;dr tho: Warp 5 drive is invented by humans so humans can finally go fast enough to explore more than just the Vulcans' backyard but the Vulcans are all "No it's dangerous don't go outside" while humans are like "We're a grown-ass world and we'll go where we want you're not my real dad!" Also there's some time travel.

## The Andorian Incident

Scott Bakula accidentally becomes Snowden for Andorians, years before Snowden or even Jewel vs. NSA was news. "Phase pistol" fight that will make every museum conservator I know scream even though the Vulcan relics are props. The Andorian General Shran becomes Enterprise's green—err—blue power ranger.

## Cold Front

Oooooh shit time travel... time. The 29th century humans were also in Voyager I think? Now they're here but we don't get to see a cool ship. Porthos is basically a DEA drug dog that can detect time travelers.

## Shadows of P'Jem

Vulcans are pissed at Snowden—err—Archer, and Enterprise gets into even more trouble, this time with some Vulcan frenemies and Shran comes back to save Archer because he owes Archer a favor and it bugs him.

## Shockwave, Part 1 and 2

More time travel and Silik. Someone done goofed and Daniels and Archer are stuck in what looks like 1970s San Francisco but is actually 31st century San Francisco. 31st century iPhones can Facetime into the past. Still no cool future ships.

## Stigma

Despite the fact that Star Trek has generally fumbled on having openly LGBT characters in the show, Enterprise was, I think, basically the only show on a major network at the time (well, UPN) to have a polyamorous major character, Dr. Phlox. One of Dr. Phlox's wives busts a move on Tucker, who is as hardcore a Florida southerner as one can be in the 22nd century, and awkwardness ensues.

We also learn that mind melding is, at this time, forbidden by Vulcans and that it can lead to a psychically-transmitted-disease, Pa'nar syndrome. T'Pol was forcibly mind-melded with in the last season and infected, but can't tell the Vulcans because its a huge stigma and she'd lose her career and status. The uptight Vulcans don't care about curing AID—err—Pa'nar because they assume everyone who has it are all degenerate mend melders who should die. Dr. Phlox, being a chill Denobulan, tries to figure out a treatment by asking some Vulcans at a conference but the Vulcan doctors start getting suspicious, until one of them comes out as a mind-melder and is all "fuck the high command, I'm out and proud!"

## Cease-Fire

The ultimate destination at the end of Enterprise's journey, as hinted by time-traveling randos throughout the series, is the Federation. The passionate, volatile Andorians and chill but no-fucks-given Vulcans have a history of beef between them. Archer, being human and neutral if only because Earth's alliance with Vulcan is barely that and he's the only person Shran trusts, is asked to set go camp-David and negotiate a peace agreement. Peace as a general concept is a goal for all the species involved, but its here that we see why it hadn't happened yet. It would take a species that can balance both reason and
empathy to get both sides talking.

Humanity's most recent memory in the 22nd century was it's recovery from the destruction of its civilization as nations put aside their differences to work together for bigger things. This is the first sign we see why humans would become the instigators of the Federation.

## Future Tense

"infinite diversity in infinite combinations."

## Judgement

Klingon society as an analogy to America at the beginning of the Iraq war, basically.

## The Breach

Archer doesn't get why patients get to have a say in their own treatment, because he's Archer. Dr. Phlox doesn't get how people who his people warred with would have beef with him personally.

## Cogenerator

Another speculative fiction episode that carries a tradition of classic Trek ethical quandries, and where the line between fundamental right and cultural norm is drawn and re-drawn.

## Regeneration

Oh remember how I said you should watch First Contact? This episode is why. It's essentially the first half of Lovecraft's In the Mountains of Madness but with Borg.

## First Flight

Ok, this season's been mostly good so far and this episode is its apex. Basically a tribute to NASA (or Nascar since Trip's involved).

## The Expanse

Oh dear, more Suliban. In this episode, another temporal cold war faction, the Xindi, are pissed by the lack of Waffle House in the Delphic expanse and take it out on northern Florida. Never forget.

_Editor's note: This is where I left off writing in 2014. It's the year 2020 I'm once again self-quarantined so here's the rest..._

_...basically all of season 3 is everything on CNN during the Bush years shoehorned into spaceships. If you want a better version of that, watch Battlestar Galactica instead._

## Azati Prime

Axis of Evil, but dumb is making weapons of mass destruction, but underwater like in SeaQuest. Only worth watching for the time travel bit and a blurry glimpse of familiar-named ship in the future. Archer stops being Jack Bauer in space for almost two whole seconds.

## Damage

A follow-up to Azati Prime. Archer goes back to being shitty Jack Bauer. Season three was garbage. The villains were basically what someone would come up with if they took bad drugs at a pet shop with a TV in the background in 2003. You only need to watch Damage if you kept watching Azati Prime after the kewl time travel part and want to see how it ends.

_Season four, on the other hand, is the best season._

## Home
Worth watching due to Tucker meeting T'Pol's mom. Also, Tucker and T'Pol are a thing now but T'Pol's mom doesn't know that... is it because T'Pol sees Tucker as a casual sideboi, or something else? Stay tuned!

ALSO IMPORTANT: Phlox learns about the rise of xenophobia against aliens on Earth after the Xindi attack. When I first started watching Enterprise, I thought Phlox was a pointless character but as the series went on, I realize he serves as a sort of north star example of what humanity could become. Except for doing the pufferfish thing he does sometimes, that's dumb.

## Borderland
This is the beginning of the Augments arc, which is ENT's take on Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS)'s _Space Seed_, where, if anyone recalls that classic, is where a genetically-enhanced human from the erm, 20th century is found in a derelict ship and one of them gets defrosted, causing shenanigans. The Eugenics Wars are something generally kept far in the background of Star Trek's world-building, probably due to the fact that it was pegged to happening in the 1990s by writers in the 1960s and, well, it's 2020 and it didn't happen. Enterprise decides to explore it a bit. Phlox and Not-Data Not-Noonien-Soong have some great dialog that reminds me of ahistorical "tEcH iS nEUtRaL" arguments, and their refutation, which Phlox chimes in on pretty effectively.

The Augments are like the Nietzscheans from Andromeda, which is the show Enterprise almost was, making me wonder if this was the show's way of trying to come back to some elements of that after Andromeda tanked. There's even a Nietzsche quote near the end of the episode (exactly the one you're thinking of).

Oh, also the Orions from TOS make an appearance, I guess.

## Cold Station 12
We finally get to see Phlox's pen pal!! He's real, not imaginary! He hates those flickering lights in the lab, they drive him CrAzY!!! The Augments are great villains; they're basically hot sociopaths who learned how to interact with regular humans by watching Kill Bill. Even with their enhanced genes though, it turns out they're not immune to ~ drama ~. As with _Borderland_, the dialog between Soong and Phlox, Archer is also p great, and Archer/Phlox's reflection on where humanity landed on the ban on genetic enhancement is a chefs-kiss example of Star Trek's use of science fiction as a vehicle to let the audience ask ourselves hard questions. Archer, despite usually saying something eye-roll-inducing, manages to utter my favorite bit of dialog in the whole series:

> Why are you so surprised? Whenever a group of people start believing they're better than everyone else, the results are always the same.

## The Augments
Picks up where Cold Station 12 left off, more Augment drama ensues and Data's great-grandpa learns a valuable lesson.

## The Forge
Much of Enterprise focuses on the tension between Vulcans being selective about how they influence humanity's future in space. This is the beginning on an arc that has humans derping around in Vulcan's internal politics. Have you ever noticed that ENT refers to the Vulcan government as the high command, while other series taking place after ENT refer to it as the high council? Hrmm.....

## Awakening
The events in The Forge lead to Soval, who was a douche at the beginning of the series who hated humanity's cowboy ways to become it's biggest advocate, ruffling all kinds of feathers at the High Council. We also get to see the [SORT-OF] GHOST OF FUCKING SURAK!! Also a familiar Vulcan who makes an appearance in TOS (no, not Spock or Sarak).

## Kir'Shara
What if the protestant reformation, but in space and also some Indiana Jones vibes? This is where the arc ends, and also the Andorians and of course, Shran come in as humans start playing more of a role of getting aliens to maybe not blow each other up.

This arc explores Vulcan politics and spirituality to a degree that goes further than anything in TOS and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) (that I know of).

Vulcan culture was a work in progress for the writers of TOS and heavily influenced by Leonard Nimoy as he was figuring out who his character should be, by inventing what his culture was. Nimoy died a few months after I wrote the first draft of this guide, but watching this arc again makes me feel like his _katra_ is still alive in it.

## Babel One
Shran gets his ass kicked by Tellerites (allegedly) and has to abandon his ship. Now Enterprise has to make the Andorians and the Tellerites not fight each other too! Also they both end up on board the Enterprise and Archer has to babysit Shran and the Tellerite ambassador, who both hate each other, awkward! There's a twist though.

## United
Picks up where Babel One leaves off. Basically the Romulans are up to NO GOOD but their covert operation ends up going awry. Shran's questionable relationship to his attractive subordinate ends up making him want to fight the Tellerites even more! Archer wants the Andorians and Tellerites, who hate each other, to work together to trawl for the Romulan's lost predator drone. Could this kind of cooperation be a precursor to something more... official? Shran and Archer have a knife fight for some reason.

_If you're wondering who the weird goblins are hanging out with the Romulans, those are the Remans, who are a subjugated species living on one of Romulus's moons. They were in Star Trek: Nemesis, which came out while Enterprise was on the air and was mostly terrible, but unfortunately necessary watching if you plan on watching Star Trek: Picard (PIC)._

## The Aenar
The final part of the Shran-packed arc, we go to Gethen—err, Andoria to visit some Andorians that are reclusive anarchist telepaths that happen to make good drone pilots, one of which the Romulans are using  to make their ships go fast, like Shevek in the Dispossessed. Doctor Phlox for some reason is the one building some homemade VR rig he probably found on some subreddit so that they can use it to fux with the Romulan drone ship.

## Affliction
Tucker transfers to the Columbia to become a full-time sadboi even though T'Pol is single again and I'd be pretty excited about that.

Have you ever wondered why Klingons in TOS have smooth foreheads? This arc finally explains that... also, remember Section 31 from DS9?

## Divergence
Picks up where Affliction leaves off and finished the story. Also Tucker's back on Enterprise for some reason but still a sadboi.

## In a Mirror, Darkly, Part 1 and 2
We finally get a fucked up spooky universe score for the intro instead of that stupid country song.

Remember the Mirror universe from TOS and DS9 where everything is the same, but with more evil and bad acting? Remember how the Defiant in TOS (no not the one from DS9) just sort of disappeared into the past slash another dimension and Starfleet was like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯? This episodes explains what happened and we get to see the Tholians for the first time since the 60s, back when they were made of cardboard and glitter. They have limbs now, thanks to computer graphics being a thing in 2005.

Also the pain tube from beginning of this episode and the mirror universe in general might make an appearance in Star Trek: Discovery (ST:DISCO) so while this arc is filler, it's also a prequel to some DISCO eps (and a sequel to some TOS eps).

ENT was pretty careful to faithfully recreate the Defiant as it would have been portrayed in the 1960s. They go all-out with this and even make the cast wear TOS-era uniforms and eat the space jello cubes for some reason. Also, there's a Gorn in this episode! It's CGI instead of a stiff lizard suit so they can actually move fast. As per Mirror universe canon, Vulcan dudes, including Soval, have a goatee.

## Demons
Ugh, they brought the country song intro BACK. 

Some plot holes on why Tucker and T'Pol's baby shower doesn't involve them and is also on the moon. Also, there's no Photoshop or deepfake in the 22nd century but apparently CRISPR is magic by then. We get to see a speed by Colonel Green, from that part of post-WWIII Earth history that Star Trek only mentions in passing (Colonel Green was featured briefly, with no real dialog in one TOS episode, along with Ghengis Khan and Kahless). We see that even after world peace, some of humanity's worst impulses didn't join the ruins of the war. Aside from Green's 21st century eugenics fixation, we see the 22nd century has its own xenophobic tendencies, eerily prescient for a show in 2015 to call out the danger of an "Earth First" attitude.

Also, Travis's ex is apparently Project Veritas, with similarly bad opsec.... or is she?

## Terra Prime
Mars! A "whatever" planet in most of Star Trek outside of PIC. Richard Spencer and the mooninites decided to hijack a bigass laser there and threaten to blow up cities on Earth, for humanity's benefit somehow.

## These Are the Voyages...
Meanwhile, in the 24th century, we get to see some TNG cast play Bridge Crew with the Enterprise mod. GREAT SPEECH AT THE END THO!!!!11
